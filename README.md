# 911-Call-Assessment---Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
This project explores a dataset of 911 calls to uncover insights about call types, locations, and times. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, we aim to gain a better understanding of patterns in emergency calls and any trends that could help improve emergency response and resource allocation.
